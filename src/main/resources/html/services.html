              The smog test technicians at California Motor Works & Tires are certified and continually monitored by the Bureau of Automotive Repair to ensure every test is performed properly and meets state standards. Smog checks are relatively quick, taking an average 20 to 30 minutes. 
			  <br><br>The process is divided into three parts:<br>
			  <br>

                  Emissions test - Measures the vehicle’s Hydrocarbons (HC), Carbon Monoxides (CO), and Nitrides of Oxygen Oxides, the three chemicals responsible for smog.
                  Visual inspection - Verifies that all emissions components on the vehicle are present and properly connected, and that there is no visible black or white smoke coming from the tailpipe.
                  Functional inspection - Examines the On Board Diagnostic (OBD) system, which includes inspection for any fault codes in the vehicle’s computer.
                  When you come to California Motor Works & Tires for a smog inspection, don’t forget to bring your DMV registration form. Test results are sent electronically to the DMV.<br><br> Contact us to schedule a biannual smog check!
                  SMOG CHECK FAILURE
                  If your vehicle fails the smog check, it means a component or system is not functioning properly enough to meet the requirements set by the California Air Resources Board.

                  Occasionally, the problem is as simple as a Check Engine light that was recently on but is now cleared, or a battery that was recently disconnected. But in most cases of a failed smog check, a thorough diagnostic service will be necessary to pinpoint the problem.

                  <br><br>At California Motor Works & Tires, our expert technicians will diagnose the cause of the smog check failure and recommend repairs to ensure your vehicle passes the next test. And as a certified STAR smog check station, we also offer repairs for gross polluters, which are vehicles with extremely high levels of smog-causing chemicals. </p>

            <div class="card-body">
			  <font face="Century Gothic">
			  Vehicle wheels perform best when they’re lined up according to manufacturer specifications, but potholes, sharp turns, and unexpected bumps can send wheels out of alignment. Unfortunately, it only takes a small shift in alignment to lead to poor vehicle handling and control, lower gas mileage, and uneven, premature tire wear.

                  At California Motor Works & Tires in San Diego, our certified technicians perform wheel alignment on all makes and models using state-of-the-art, computerized alignment equipment. 
				  <br><br>We offer:

                  Front-wheel alignment<br>
                  Four-wheel alignment<br>
                  SUV wheel alignment<br>
                  Light truck wheel alignment<br>
                  Van wheel alignment<br>
                  4x4 wheel alignment<br>
                  Our expert wheel alignment services will ensure the proper functioning of your wheels and help maximize your vehicle’s maneuverability, tire performance, and fuel efficiency.
				<br><br>
                  COMPREHENSIVE WHEEL ALIGNMENT SERVICE
                  Normal wear and tear is the most common culprit of wheel misalignment, but the problem could also be something as minor as low tire pressure or as major as undiagnosed damage to the suspension system. At California Motor Works & Tires, our certified technicians are trained to inspect all components related to alignment to ensure there isn’t an underlying mechanical or maintenance issue. Our comprehensive wheel alignment service includes:
					<br><br>
                  Precise measurements of three wheel angles (toe, caster, and camber)<br>
                  Wheel angle adjustments to manufacturer specifications<br>
                  Final alignment readings to verify correct alignment<br>
                  Thorough inspection of suspension and steering systems<br>
                  Inspection of shocks and struts for damage and wear<br>
                  Inspection of tire wear, tire condition, and tire air pressure<br>
                  If we find an underlying problem that’s causing your vehicle’s wheels to slip out of alignment, we will expertly repair or replace damaged or worn components to save you from further misalignment issues down the road.
					<br><br>
                  SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF WHEEL MISALIGNMENT
                  As a general rule, you should have your vehicle’s wheel alignment checked every 6,000 miles or 6 months, but alignment issues can easily occur between check-ups. Minor accidents, hitting potholes or curbs, and zooming over speed bumps can result in wheel misalignment, so if you notice any of the following signs and symptoms, bring your vehicle in for an inspection:
				<br><br>
				  Excessive or uneven tire wear<br>
				  Severe drop in fuel economy<br>
				  Vehicle pulls to one side<br>
				  Vehicle shakes or vibrates<br>
				  Steering wheel is not centered when driving in a straight line<br>
				  Squeaking, creaking, knocking, or rubbing sounds coming from underneath the vehicle<br>

                  WARNING SIGNS OF BRAKE PROBLEMS<br>
                  Some brake system components are designed to alert you when service or repair is needed, such as brake pads squealing when they wear down too far. But you’ll also want to stay alert for these other warning signs that indicate a brake system inspection is necessary:
					<br><br>
                  Grinding sound when you apply the brakes<br>
                  Brake pedal pulsates or feels spongy<br>
                  Vehicle pulls to one side when braking<br>
                  Vehicle vibrates when braking<br>
                  Vehicle takes longer than usual to come to a stop<br>
                  Brake warning light comes on while driving</font>

                Optimal performance and safety aren’t the only reasons to keep up with regular vehicle maintenance. In many cases, you’ll need to prove your car has been regularly serviced in order to keep your warranty valid. And if you ever decide to sell your car, you’re more likely to get a higher asking price if you can prove it has been well-maintained</font>
